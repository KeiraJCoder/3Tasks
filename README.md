# Spoons 🥄🧠

**Only do what you have the spoons for.**  
A gentle productivity app built for neurodivergent, chronically ill, and overthinky humans.

**Spoons** helps you manage your energy — not just your time. Start your day with a motivation check-in, earn spoons through self-care, and spend them intentionally on tasks that truly matter.
